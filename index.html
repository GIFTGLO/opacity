    <div class="n1">Skunks have moderately elongated bodies with relatively short, well-muscled legs. They have five toes on each foot, and
    long front claws for digging. Most skunks have black and white fur, but some may be brown or grey. All skunks are
    striped. Depending on the species, a skunk may have a single wide stripe along the back and tail, or two thinner
    stripes, or a series of white spots and broken stripes.

<div class="n2">The Grevy's zebra now live in Ethiopia and northern Kenya, there are three main types of zebra, but the Gr√©vy's zebra
has declined in numbers at around 54% since the 1980s, where the population was estimated at 5,800. Today the population
is at approximately 2,000. Over the years the numbers have severely decreased due to many reasons, from habitat loss and
competing with other grazers to sadly being hunted for their skins.</div>
<div class="n3">Cat's whiskers are mood indicators. If they hang down relaxed, the cat is satisfied. If they are facing straight ahead,
they may be angry.</div>
